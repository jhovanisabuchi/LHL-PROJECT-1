# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project aims to track each visitor's activity on the site, evaluating product sales, stock levels, pricing, and customer preferences across various locations. The main objective is to build a comprehensive tracking system that monitors visitor behavior, providing insights into visit frequency, engagement, order details, and revenue generation.The projectâ€™s goal is to understand and analyze data to support informed decision-making. This includes identifying locations with top sales, high-revenue products, and popular product categories by location and visitor demographics. The insights will guide strategic decisions such as inventory management, pricing strategies, and targeted marketing efforts to improve overall performance.

## Process
1, Data cleaning
     # remove duplicates
     # remove nulls 
     # remove rows with missing data or try to fill the missing data from other relevnant tables or column
     # standardize the data like missspeling , capitalization

2, data analizing : Combined information from these tables to calculate insights such as
    # Frequency of site visits by each visitor
    # Average session duration
    # Order frequency per visitor
    # Revenue generated per session, city, and product
    # Developed SQL queries to join and analyze data across tables efficiently


## Results
The data provides comprehensive insights into various aspects of visitor behavior and product performance on the site. 
Key findings include
 # Visitor Information
     Detailed tracking of each visitor's activity, including duration of site visits, frequency of visits, and products ordered.
 # Product Performance
  Identification of top-performing products by revenue, as well as those with the highest order quantities, allowing for targeted inventory and marketing strategies.
 # Revenue Insights 
   Calculation of total revenue segmented by month, year, and location, enabling a deeper understanding of seasonal trends and regional performance.
 # Visitor Engagement
   Analysis of visit frequency to determine the most engaged customers and identify patterns of returning visitors.
 # Source of Customer Visits
   Classification of customers by referral type, distinguishing between direct visits and referrals, which informs strategies for customer acquisition.

These insights were obtained and refined through SQL queries, facilitating data exploration and enabling valuable decision-making tools for product, marketing, and customer engagement strategies.


## Challenges 
# Handling Missing Data
  Dealing with incomplete data entries required strategies to maintain data integrity and accuracy.
# HAndling duplicates 
   Identifying and removing duplicate records. 
# Creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): 
  Designing an ERD for the database to represent the relationships between tables and the overall database structure.
# Addressing Data Dependencies and Redundancies
   managing data dependencies and redundancies.
# Identifying Primary and Foreign Keys
    Establishing the primary and foreign keys for each table was a complex task, creating relationships among entities.

## Future Goals
# Allocate more time to thoroughly examine each dataset, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of all data points and their interdependencies.
# Break down large tables into smaller, more manageable tables to reduce dependency and redundancy, which will improve data integrity and optimize query 
  performance.
# Clearly identify primary and foreign keys for each table to establish well-defined relationships and improve database structure.
# Create an updated Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that clearly illustrates connections and relationships among tables and entities. 
# Add  SQL queries aimed at generating clearer, more actionable insights, making the data more accessible and understandable for users.
